In this experiment you will see how to manipulate dungeon spawn rates. This will spawn a human prison on the garden planet.
Which means you either need to;

	Reset your universe [ Recommended ]
	Reset starting garden planet
	Find a new garden planet.

Unfortunately there is no way to choose how often a "specific" dungeon spawns from a list.
If you want to do that I suggest creating more alternative planet biomes of similar nature. [ Multiple Forest planet types ] and choosing only a few dungeons per planet.

You will notice Dungeon Count Range
First number = minimum number of dungeons spawned
Last number = Maximum number

Keep in mind if the minimum number of dungeons cannot be spawned, none will be.

As for the code it self, this is the proper way to add dungeon and manipulate the information.
If you try to batch add, it will act as an "overwrite" removing any information which is different and overwriting any other mods it loads after. 
So in other words you will need to add each dungeon one at a time in a already existing list.
