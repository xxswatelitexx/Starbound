What you may not notice unlike the others.
This experiment is dependent on another one, which means it will not work without the Multiexperiment mod.
This is done by the "includes" function in the pak.modinfo file.

In this experiment I wanted to learn how to make a chest "Read" its contents.
After which based on what it "Read" I wanted it to be able to perform an action.
In this case what the chest does is - it looks for a particular type of item. Any item with the extension "H_sbno"
It then removes the "H_sbno" from the name of the item and spawns it. As of the current version it spawns it 4 blocks under it self.
