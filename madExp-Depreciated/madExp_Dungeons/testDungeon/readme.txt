Now that we have our tools and knowledge ready, the first thing we will want to do is look up the vanilla dungeons to get a basic idea of the format we will be dealing with. Two good places to start is the Avian village and the Apex Laboratories. 

From this point on we will want to follow as close to the vanilla style colouring policies as much as possible. Though not required it makes things easier for other modders and you later on. 

The Avian village gives us a basic idea of dungeon structure while Apex Labs gives us a better idea of component based structures.
The pink area ( "value" : [255, 0, 220, 255] ) is essentially a neutral zone which interacts with the world, which is not defined.
This is important as this area will also be required when you want to use connectors to link up the parts together.
