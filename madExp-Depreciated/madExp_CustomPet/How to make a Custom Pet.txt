Simple Instructions
1. Draw your pet on the existing sprite sheets provided in monster / pets / parts
2. Must be within the frame size 32 x 32
3. Rename EVERY file and folder and EVERY instance of customPet in EVERY file ( including modinfo file ) 
	You can open the files using notepad or equivalent- do not use a fancy word program like Microsoft word. Must be UTF-8 Complaint. Fancy programs can use non standard characters which will result in it not working.
4. If you did it right, spawn by typing
	/admin
	/spawnitem pethouseName
	*where Name = pet name with the first letter capital.

Moderate Instructions
1. Same as simple instructions
2. pethouseName - the "Name" part should begin with a capital letter and not include the letters "pet" in the first 3 letters.
