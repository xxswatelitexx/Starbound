In this set of experiments we will look at how to store data in an object and retain it on destruction.
A lot of mods have been doing this such has Improved Containers or Enhanced storage so I wanted to see how.

#Experiment 1
This experiment was made possible to v6ooo without him. I don't think the information provided here would have ever been known.
In this test we use a parameter which was added in back in 2014 which was little known,
"retainObjectParametersInItem" : true,

By adding this value into the JSON file I was able to retain the JSON stored data even after destruction as the experiment will show.
